Responsive is better than fast
It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
No pressure, no diamonds.
Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.
Take the risk or lose the chance.
Focus on the good.
Yes! Yes! You can do it!
You are stronger than you think you are.
Begin.
Smile, it’s free therapy.
Action is the foundational key to all success.
A goal without a plan is just a wish.
Success is the accumulation of small advantages over time.
Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
Don’t be busy, be productive.
I learned the value of hard work by working hard.
Work hard in silence. Let success make the noise.
